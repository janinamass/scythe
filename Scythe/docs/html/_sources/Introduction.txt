Introduction
============
Scythe picks best matching transcripts for one-to-one orthologous genes from two or more species.

The goal is to provide the best, i.e. most homologous set of sequences, for a subsequent multiple sequence alignment in order
to minimize sources for misalignment in an automated fashion.
Scythe will perform pairwise global alignments using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [NE1970] as implemented in needleall as part of the EMBOSS package [EMB2000].

Please see the :ref:`tutorial` on how to use Scythe.

Important! `needleall` appears to be broken in (the ubuntu package for) EMBOSS 6.6.0.0; this is working with `needleall` from EMBOSS 6.4.0.0.

Algorithms and Application
==========================
Scythe performs pairwise global alignments [NEED1970] to measure the similarity between transcripts.
Transcripts are only compared between species.

There are three main strategies implemented in Scythe to deal with the sequences after scoring:
A single-linkage approach either starting with reference transcripts as seed (sl_ref_) and adding best matching sequences from non-reference species 
or starting out with the best matching transcript pair for a gene (sl_glob_). 
A `reference species` is defined as a species that has only one transcript (`reference transcript`) for a gene.
Every gene is processed individually, a `reference species` is only local to a gene and is automatically derived from the input data.
Alternatively, the maximum-sum (mx_sum_) approach calculates the score for all transcript pairings between the species and return a maximum-scoring set.
Please note that this approach might not be feasable for large data sets.

.. _mx_sum:

mx_sum
------
mx_sum (maximum sum) returns an optimal solution for the problem of score maximization. There are, however, scenarios where this would not represent the desired result: In cases of single-transcript outliers, their pairwise score to all other sequences is always taken into account and may favor sequences that are less dissimilar to the outlier.

.. _sl_ref:

sl_ref
------
sl_ref (single linkage reference)  finds similar gene models given a reference species.
This single-linkage approach starts with a reference transcript as seed and adds best matching sequences from non-reference species. A `reference species` is defined as a species that has only one transcript (`reference transcript`) for a gene. Every gene is processed individually, a `reference species` is only local to a gene and is derived from the input data.

.. sl_glob:

sl_glob
-------
sl_glob (single linkage global) is similar to the `sl_ref` approach, but starts out with the best matching pair. This should provide a good starting point in absence of a reference gene model and may be able circumvent outliers.
